This project will house scenes for level design, interiors and exteriors, lighting, audio and particle systems,

Game is a sci-fi based collectin game where to goalk is to find all of the power cores hidden throughout the building I created 
The Game is meant to be completed through one specific path, jumping allows you to see through walls, but i could not fix this and 
the level design is what i tried to focus on

## Scene List
- MainMenu - provide access to other scenes
- Probuilder - basic use of probuilder to get comfortable with core functions
